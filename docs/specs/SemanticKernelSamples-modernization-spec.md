# Specification Quality Checklist: Joke Agent Applications

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before planning
**Created**: 2026-02-12
**Specification**: specs/modernization-spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Open questions are limited to 3 or fewer

## Notes

- Python language is mentioned in Migration Constraints (Section 9) as an explicit user requirement — this is acceptable as a project constraint rather than an implementation prescription.
- 2 open questions remain; both can be resolved with reasonable defaults if stakeholder input is unavailable.
- All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for planning.
